Go to the customize page <http://www.tumblr.com/customize/your-blog-name> of the newly created tumblr blog, then copy/paste all the code from this project's index.html by clicking on **Edit HTML**. You have to replace all the existing code - yes top to bottom includind <html> tags.

	* Site Name: name-of-site
	* Site Shortname: whatever you feel like, personnaly i use the name of the tumblr. You will need to use this **Shortname** at next step
	* Enable Promoted Discovery: do you want adverts?

2. The next step is on the setup page, and the only thing you have to do is again go back to your customize page <http://www.tumblr.com/customize> (add /your-blog-name to this url adress to reach your blog customization page) and at the field:
